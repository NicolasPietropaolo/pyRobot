# pyRobot
For this project, I used Python to create a program that controls a Raspberry Pi 3 Robot Vehicle. This program has the capability to control the direction the robot travels in
such as right, left, straight, and forwards. It also can start and stop the robot at any time and has object detection programming where the vehicle will be able to detect if 
an object is too close to it and avoid a collision with it. Overall it was a very interested project that I enjoyed making and using on the robot!
